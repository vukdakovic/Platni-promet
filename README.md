# Platni-promet

The project I did as a final test (exam) in the Java Junior course. 

The task that was appointed to us was to build a front and back-end web application of an Online payments system (Platni promet).

Apon the end date for the project, I managed to create (to my knowledge) a working back-end application.
The biggest problem was time, and that is why my application was lacking.
However, as I progress with the knowledge and skills, I will be returning to this project and immplementing new things that I learn, fixing issues, etc.
